# MainFlowTask_3- Design the Login Page Using NetBeans IDE (Design Window)
Design a simple login page using NetBeans IDE with a JFrame Form. The interface includes a title label ("Login Page"), username and password fields (JTextField and JPasswordField), and a login button (JButton). Components are arranged using GroupLayout or GridBagLayout, with proper alignment and spacing. Tooltips provide input hints. The form size is set to 400x300 pixels and centered using setLocationRelativeTo(null). Functionality can be added to validate user credentials through a button click event using a basic if-else check.
